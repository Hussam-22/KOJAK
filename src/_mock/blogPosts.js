        title: `Question: A year ago, I rented a villa from a real estate office, and the lease contract was for a year and a month. The lease expires in February 2023. Two weeks ago, the real estate office sent an email informing me that the rent will be increased. Is the real estate office legally entitled to increase the rent and how much is the legal increase according to the rental law in Dubai? Do they have right to evict me from the property if I do not agree to the increase? According to the rental law, who is responsible for the maintenance of the property, the owner or the tenant? Please advise.`,
        text: `Answer: The landlord has the right to increase the rent but he should do so no less than 90 days prior to the date on which the tenancy contract expires. Otherwise, he doesn’t have the right to oblige the tenant to accept the new rental nor does he have the right to evict the tenant from the tenancy.`,

        text: `This is stipulated in Article 13 and 14 of Law No. (33) of 2008 Amending Law No. (26) of ‘2007 Regulating the Relationship between Landlords and Tenants in the Emirate of Dubai’ which state: For the purposes of renewing the tenancy contract, the landlord and tenant may, prior to the expiry of the tenancy contract, amend any of the terms of the tenancy contract or review the rent, whether increasing or decreasing it.

      Should the landlord and tenant fail to reach an agreement, then the tribunal may determine the fair rent, taking into account the criteria stipulated in Article (9) of this Law.
      
      Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, if either party to the tenancy contract wishes to amend any of its terms in accordance with Article (13) of this Law, that party must notify the other party of same no less than ninety (90) days prior to the date on which the tenancy contract expires.
      
      There is no definite increase for the rental amount, it is usually determined by the municipality or the authority concerned, as per Article 10 of the law, who shall have the exclusive authority to specify percentage of rent increase in the Emirate, with regard to of economic circumstances.
      
      Moreover, the Rental Dispute Centre (tribunal) in case of a dispute between the parties have the right to determine the rental amount for the property, taking into account the criteria determining the percentage of rent increase set by RERA, the overall economic situation in the Emirate, the condition of the real property, and the average rent of similar real property markets within the same area, and in accordance with any applicable legislation in the Emirate concerning real property rent, or any other factors which the tribunal deems appropriate.
      
      The responsibility for the maintenance is usually on the landlord unless otherwise agreed between the parties. Article 16 of the law states that the landlord shall, during validity of the tenancy contract, be liable for undertaking maintenance of the property and shall rectify any defects or faults that affect tenant’s intended benefit from the property, unless the two parties agree otherwise. This shall not violate tenant’s obligation to execute agreed upon maintenance or that which is ordinarily done by tenants.`,

        title: 'Affordable locations are catching up',
        text: `By now, all established and emerging residential locations in Dubai have gone through double-digit rental – and property value – increases. Take Dubai South, for instance. The mega mixed-use destination had seen rent and property values hold steady in 2021, when Dubai’s established locations – the Marina, Downtown and the Palm – started to rev up.

        It’s not the case any longer – but with some differences. “In Dubai South, rental rises (of 15 per cent) have been far outstripped by the gains in property values (26 per cent) in the 12 months to June,” said Altaf Abbas, Head of Research at the consultancy GCP.
        
        “This is because the new apartments and villas have pulled in end-users, as did the older developments there.”
        
        Rentals at ready-to-move in two-bedroom apartments in Dubai South are at Dh60,000-Dh65,000, based on listings in the leading property portals. Those at the Expo Village come in higher, at Dh80,000 plus`,

        title: 'Renting still the best option?',
        text: `The situation in another fast-emerging mid-market residential location – Arjan – shows another dynamic.

        “Rents are going up more in Arjan even with all the new offplan project launches and recent handovers of completed homes,” said Abbas. “One would have thought this would dampen rent increases - but it hasn’t. The reason is because it costs more to mortgage a property in Arjan right now than it does to rent there.
        
        “An offplan property is selling at Dh1,250 per square foot on average, while that for ready stock in Arjan is around Dh850.” (And there aren’t that many ready units available…)

        Many of these investors are betting big that rental demand – and rate hikes - in Dubai will continue to hold sway for more time to come. “I have an overseas investor wanting to buy bulk – about 20 ready apartments at or around Dh1 million each – and have them placed for rentals,” said a developer. “Every investor in Dubai real estate has an eye on the city adding to its population base.”
        
        But if developers are serious wanting more end-users, offering rent-to-own schemes is the way to go, insist some market sources.`,

        “Focussing on investors alone will not add depth to the market. As had happened in 2021 – when the current Dubai property market wave took off – the need is for more end-user buying.”

        You needn’t be, according to a top official with the mortgage-focussed fintech Huspy.
        
        “We must remember that the UAE not only has some of the most competitive property prices among global cities, but the interest rates are very attractive,” said Fouad Chemlati, General Manager for Mortgages at the Dubai-based company.
        
        “In the US, for example, the average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage is over 7 per cent right now.

“The UAE market had already priced in the interest rate increases. That’s why with the last two rounds of (by US Federal Reserve and repeated here) hikes, we actually saw interest rates being reduced, benefiting homebuyers.

“Right now, the lowest 3-year fixed mortgage available is 4.24 per cent. On average, interest rates are at approximately 4.7 per cent for residents and 5.14 per cent for non-residents.”`,

        text: `Local lenders are spreading the word among prospective property buyers, especially end-users and who need mortgage support to get the deals done.

        Their messaging is straight-forward enough - lock in the initial payment period, of three to five years. During this period, at some point, the central banks would start cutting down on rates, which would ease the payment obligations for homeowners.
        
        To smooth out property buyer concerns even further, some UAE banks are even testing out fixed-rate only mortgage financing. Anything to keep the UAE property boom going for longer… According to banking and real estate sources, UAE banks did not waste any time putting together mortgage financing packages that could convince a potential property buyer to go ahead with the transaction.

“Because any deal that gets put off because of lack of mortgage support or buyer concerns about the cost of servicing the loan is a lost deal,” said an estate agent. “Apart from a brief period during Q4-2022, UAE banks have been proactive in making the deals stick.”`,

        “Since March 2022, the Fed has increased rates to 5.5 per cent across 11 rate hikes. While this meant an increase in monthly payments for homebuyers, it also encouraged many to take a leap towards ownership and ahead of future hikes.
        
        “For homeowners in the UAE, the 3-month EIBOR was 0.56 per cent in March 2022, a difference of 4.8 per cent currently, which equates to Dh4,000 per month on Dh1 million over 25 years.”

        The area is seeing average two-bedroom rents at Dh35,000, a near 10 per cent increase from last year.`,

        text: `Sharjah’s freehold property market has been one of the stellar performers of recent years, more so since the final quarter of 2022, when the emirate widened the scope of freehold titles. More recently, Sharjah confirmed that government-owned land would be released to private developer-investors, and that too could see more freehold projects launched.

        But it will be a gradual process, according to a top official at Savills. "Smaller private developers are exploring opportunities in the emirate - it’s unlikely we’ll see any large new developers enter the market in the short-term," said Shane Breen, who heads the Sharjah operations at the property firm."`,

        title: `Offplan launches`,
        text: `On the offplan launch side, there have been niche launches, such as the one from ASAS Real Estate (the property arm of Sharjah Islamic Bank) in Khorfakkan.

        "The Sharjah market is experiencing significant growth at the moment as it develops and matures," said Breen. "The rise of masterplanned developments has primarily driven this growth, resulting in record transaction volumes across the emirate."
        
        Last year, overall transaction values were at $6.6 billion and January 2023 numbers on their own were 'already at 15 per cent of all of 2022'. "The growing number of projects across Sharjah means that it can now cater to an expanding client base," added Breen.`,
