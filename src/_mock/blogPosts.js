        title: `Question: A year ago, I rented a villa from a real estate office, and the lease contract was for a year and a month. The lease expires in February 2023. Two weeks ago, the real estate office sent an email informing me that the rent will be increased. Is the real estate office legally entitled to increase the rent and how much is the legal increase according to the rental law in Dubai? Do they have right to evict me from the property if I do not agree to the increase? According to the rental law, who is responsible for the maintenance of the property, the owner or the tenant? Please advise.`,
        text: `Answer: The landlord has the right to increase the rent but he should do so no less than 90 days prior to the date on which the tenancy contract expires. Otherwise, he doesn’t have the right to oblige the tenant to accept the new rental nor does he have the right to evict the tenant from the tenancy.`,

        text: `This is stipulated in Article 13 and 14 of Law No. (33) of 2008 Amending Law No. (26) of ‘2007 Regulating the Relationship between Landlords and Tenants in the Emirate of Dubai’ which state: For the purposes of renewing the tenancy contract, the landlord and tenant may, prior to the expiry of the tenancy contract, amend any of the terms of the tenancy contract or review the rent, whether increasing or decreasing it.

      Should the landlord and tenant fail to reach an agreement, then the tribunal may determine the fair rent, taking into account the criteria stipulated in Article (9) of this Law.
      
      Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, if either party to the tenancy contract wishes to amend any of its terms in accordance with Article (13) of this Law, that party must notify the other party of same no less than ninety (90) days prior to the date on which the tenancy contract expires.
      
      There is no definite increase for the rental amount, it is usually determined by the municipality or the authority concerned, as per Article 10 of the law, who shall have the exclusive authority to specify percentage of rent increase in the Emirate, with regard to of economic circumstances.
      
      Moreover, the Rental Dispute Centre (tribunal) in case of a dispute between the parties have the right to determine the rental amount for the property, taking into account the criteria determining the percentage of rent increase set by RERA, the overall economic situation in the Emirate, the condition of the real property, and the average rent of similar real property markets within the same area, and in accordance with any applicable legislation in the Emirate concerning real property rent, or any other factors which the tribunal deems appropriate.
      
      The responsibility for the maintenance is usually on the landlord unless otherwise agreed between the parties. Article 16 of the law states that the landlord shall, during validity of the tenancy contract, be liable for undertaking maintenance of the property and shall rectify any defects or faults that affect tenant’s intended benefit from the property, unless the two parties agree otherwise. This shall not violate tenant’s obligation to execute agreed upon maintenance or that which is ordinarily done by tenants.`,

The mega mixed-use destination had seen rent and property values hold steady in 2021, when Dubai’s established locations – the Marina, Downtown and the Palm – started to rev up.

        It’s not the case any longer – but with some differences. “In Dubai South, rental rises (of 15 per cent) have been far outstripped by the gains in property values (26 per cent) in the 12 months to June,” said Altaf Abbas, Head of Research at the consultancy GCP.
        
        “This is because the new apartments and villas have pulled in end-users, as did the older developments there.”
        
        Rentals at ready-to-move in two-bedroom apartments in Dubai South are at Dh60,000-Dh65,000, based on listings in the leading property portals. Those at the Expo Village come in higher, at Dh80,000 plus`,

        “Rents are going up more in Arjan even with all the new offplan project launches and recent handovers of completed homes,” said Abbas. “One would have thought this would dampen rent increases - but it hasn’t. The reason is because it costs more to mortgage a property in Arjan right now than it does to rent there.
        
        “An offplan property is selling at Dh1,250 per square foot on average, while that for ready stock in Arjan is around Dh850.” (And there aren’t that many ready units available…)

        Many of these investors are betting big that rental demand – and rate hikes - in Dubai will continue to hold sway for more time to come. “I have an overseas investor wanting to buy bulk – about 20 ready apartments at or around Dh1 million each – and have them placed for rentals,” said a developer. “Every investor in Dubai real estate has an eye on the city adding to its population base.”

Even then, Sharjah rents still maintain a sizeable price gap compared to similar apartments and villas in Dubai.

        A two-bedroom apartment in Al Majaz would average Dh35,000 a year (up 9.4 per cent year-on-year), while a one-bed in Al Share would be around Dh20,000, up by a whopping 20 per cent. A one-bed in Al Qassimiya would be Dh22,000 a year, an increase of 22.2 per cent, according to a new report from Savills.
        
        Interestingly, the biggest increases have been noted in 1- and 2-bedroom apartments, and quite the contrast to what’s happening in Dubai, where bigger format homes have seen the bulk of the 15-35 per cent rental surge.
        
        In Sharjah, property sources reckon that rents could be in for double-digit increases this year. “The emirate’s rental scene was slower to pick up, but it’s now running on some serious gains,” said a broker. “New buildings with higher rentals have raised the asking rates, and even some of the older buildings too are going for higher leases.”
        
        One of the fastest emerging areas will be the University City/Al Muwaileh, which is where the developer Arada's massive Aljada project is based. Handover of homes in the initial phases of Aljada have hits stride, and there will be more of that this year. (A secondary market is also building up for Sharjah freehold properties.)
        
        The area is seeing average two-bedroom rents at Dh35,000, a near 10 per cent increase from last year.`,

More recently, Sharjah confirmed that government-owned land would be released to private developer-investors, and that too could see more freehold projects launched.

        But it will be a gradual process, according to a top official at Savills.

        You needn’t be, according to a top official with the mortgage-focussed fintech Huspy.
        
        “We must remember that the UAE not only has some of the most competitive property prices among global cities, but the interest rates are very attractive,” said Fouad Chemlati, General Manager for Mortgages at the Dubai-based company.
        
        “In the US, for example, the average interest rate for a 30-year mortgage is over 7 per cent right now.

“The UAE market had already priced in the interest rate increases. That’s why with the last two rounds of (by US Federal Reserve and repeated here) hikes, we actually saw interest rates being reduced, benefiting homebuyers.

“Right now, the lowest 3-year fixed mortgage available is 4.24 per cent. On average, interest rates are at approximately 4.7 per cent for residents and 5.14 per cent for non-residents.”`,

        Their messaging is straight-forward enough - lock in the initial payment period, of three to five years. During this period, at some point, the central banks would start cutting down on rates, which would ease the payment obligations for homeowners.
        
        To smooth out property buyer concerns even further, some UAE banks are even testing out fixed-rate only mortgage financing. Anything to keep the UAE property boom going for longer… According to banking and real estate sources, UAE banks did not waste any time putting together mortgage financing packages that could convince a potential property buyer to go ahead with the transaction.

“Because any deal that gets put off because of lack of mortgage support or buyer concerns about the cost of servicing the loan is a lost deal,” said an estate agent. “Apart from a brief period during Q4-2022, UAE banks have been proactive in making the deals stick.”`,

        “Since March 2022, the Fed has increased rates to 5.5 per cent across 11 rate hikes. While this meant an increase in monthly payments for homebuyers, it also encouraged many to take a leap towards ownership and ahead of future hikes.
        
        “For homeowners in the UAE, the 3-month EIBOR was 0.56 per cent in March 2022, a difference of 4.8 per cent currently, which equates to Dh4,000 per month on Dh1 million over 25 years.”

        text: `When it comes to establishing a brand online, many companies tend to prioritise the visual aspects. While this holds some truth, as images are often the first point of contact for potential clients, it is important to recognise that building an online reputation goes beyond aesthetics. A well-designed website landing page, a memorable domain name, captivating social media content, and informative blog articles all play vital roles in making a brand's image. However, it is important for companies to remember that reputation is not a fleeting achievement but rather a long-term investment. Focusing solely on quick results can lead to overlooking the significance of cultivating a strong reputation.

        According to statistics from the latest research conducted by Reputation House, almost 90 per cent of potential customers rely on reviews and advice before interacting with a company, including real estate. Despite the differing nature of buying properties compared to, for example, watches or cars, clients still look out for similar red flags across industries.
        
        • Fake subscribers: Companies that buy subscribers often face severe consequences due to their decisions. When a brand boasts hundreds of thousands of subscribers but receives only a handful of likes and zero comments on each post, it not only damages their reputation but also risks being shadow-banned. Such practices definitely lead to distrust among customers.
        
        • Scammed reviews: Imagine the situation when single negative feedback is followed by ten positive reviews published on the same day. This suspicious pattern raises alarm bells for customers, prompting them to quickly close the tab on your website.
        
        • Simple one-page websites: While minimalism may be a growing trend, it is not suitable for the real estate industry, particularly in the UAE. The website serves as the primary communication with potential clients, and it is essential to provide them with comprehensive information. A generic site with minimal details fails to engage customers and leads to losing their attention prematurely.`,

        text: `Dubai: Sharjah’s decision to open up its property market to freehold titles is paying off – since October, property values in the emirate are up 15-20 per cent as more investors enter the fray. The upturn in values could also have been helped by secondary market sales, especially of recently handed over homes at high-profile communities.

        Sharjah’s property market is geared for more handovers this year, at projects led by Arada and others. If the build up in values continue, there could be more value gains and activity in the still nascent secondary market.
        
        The in-demand properties range from Dh2 million to Dh4 million, with nearly 70 per cent being end-users. Indians make up a sizeable portion of the buyers followed by Pakistani and Arab buyers. "There is also significant interest from Emiratis from Abu Dhabi, Ras Al Khaimah and Fujairah looking to buy second/holiday homes," said a statement from the estate agency Metropolitan Premium Properties.`,

        text: `Even then, “The real estate market in Sharjah is more stable and less prone to price volatility,” said Khaled Ahmed, Sales Director for Northern Emirates at Metropolitan Premium Properties. “The changes to the real estate law by the government of Sharjah have had a positive impact on buyer interest as the emirate has witnessed a 30 percent increase in demand for offplan and ready units.
        
        “There is a lack of inventory in the market with prices of some villas even higher than in Dubai.”
        
        New high-end communities and developments coming online include the forest-themed Masar and Haayan. (Sharjah is simultaneously seeing multiple hospitality projects, including the Rove and Vida hotels.)
        
        According to data available from Sharjah Real Estate Registration Department, real estate transactions hit a peak of Dh24 billion in 2022 with 91,507 transactions compared to 84,238 transactions in 2021.`,
